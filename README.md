# LunkyBox v1.4 #

LunkyBox is a menu mod/hack for Spelunky. It was meant to be just an object spawner, but I decided to add more features.
It uses dll injection and comes with an injector that is made for it, all you have to do is run LunkyBoxInjector.exe.

Features:
- Player: Modify values like hearts, bombs, ropes, gold and items
- Object spawner: Has over 200 working objects, organized in categories
- Teleporting: Teleport the player to anywhere
- Time: Modify or freeze the stage time and total time
- Sound player: Play all 230 .wav files in Spelunky

I don't want people to use this for cheating on the leaderboards, so I made it disable the Daily Challenge while the mod is activate.

Controls is F5 to open menu, numpad 8 4 6 2 for up, left, right, down, numpad 5 to select and numpad 0 to go back. This can be changed in the config file.
