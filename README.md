LunkyBox is a menu mod/hack for Spelunky. It was meant to be just an object spawner, but I decided to add more features.
It uses dll injection and comes with an injector that is made for it, all you have to do is run LunkyBoxInjector.exe.

Features:
- Player: Modify values like hearts, bombs, ropes, gold and items
- Object spawner: Has over 200 working objects, organized in categories
- Teleporting: Teleport the player to anywhere
- Time: Modify or freeze the stage time and total time
- Sound player: Play all 230 .wav files in Spelunky

I don't want people to use this for cheating on the leaderboards, so I made it disable the Daily Challenge while the mod is activate.

Controls is F5 to open menu, numpad 8 4 6 2 for up, left, right, down, numpad 5 to select and numpad 0 to go back. This can be changed in the config file.

Known bugs:
- Changing screen resolution after opening menu might crash the game.
- If any of the player infinite options is on when going into the Yama level, the game will crash. Turn them off before going into the level, you can turn them on again after the Yama cutscene is over.
